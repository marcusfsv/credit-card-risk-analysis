--      1. Overview

-- View the first 5 rows of the dataset
SELECT * FROM credit_cards LIMIT 5;

--      2. Duplicates and missing values

-- Check the number of rows and duplicates
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS num_rows, 
    COUNT (DISTINCT card_id) AS distinct_card_id 
FROM credit_cards;

-- Checking for missing values (NULL)
SELECT

-- Checking for unique and unusual values in card_tier

-- Checking for unusual values in issued_date
SELECT
	MIN(issued_date) AS min_issued_date,

-- Checking for consistency in issued_date
SELECT

	c.created_at
FROM credit_cards cc

-- Checking for unique and unusual values in status
SELECT 
	status,
	COUNT(*)

-- Checking for consistency in status_date

-- Checking frequency for is_primary
SELECT is_primary,
	COUNT(*)
FROM credit_cards
GROUP BY 1;

--      4.	Transformation and Grouping

-- Creating a new VIEW with credit_limit bands
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW v_credit_cards AS
SELECT
  *,
  CASE
  	WHEN credit_limit <= 3000 THEN 'Low (â‰¤3K)'
	  WHEN credit_limit <= 6000 THEN 'Medium (3K-6K)'

--      5.	Cross-Tab Check

-- Checking for cross-tab consistency
SELECT

  COUNT(*)
FROM v_credit_cards
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;
