## 🔍 Overview

This project analyzes the behavior of credit card customers. The goal was to identify high-risk customer segments, detect early signs of financial distress, and provide actionable recommendations to reduce credit exposure.

Built using the **ELT** approach:
* **Extract** from CSV → **Load** into PostgreSQL → **Transform** with SQL → **Visualize** with Power BI.

## 📊 Key Insights

* Customers under 20 and those earning less than 30K show higher late payment rates and utilization.
* High-tier card holders (e.g., Black) tend to be more financially stable.
* Late payment behavior has been steady since 2019 (~7–9% annually).
* Some new or low-spending customers exhibit repeated delinquency and may require credit limit adjustments.

## 🧰 Tools

* **PostgreSQL** - Data loading, validation, profiling, and transformation (SQL)
* **SQL** - Used for joins, aggregations, data quality checks, and view creation
* **Power BI** - Data visualization and dashboard development
